## 👋 About Me

🎓 I’m currently learning at the **ALX ProDev Backend Program**, where I’m building real-world software engineering skills through hands-on projects in Django, Python, REST APIs, and more.  
💡 I began this journey to **create meaningful, data-driven solutions**—especially platforms that empower **creatives and entrepreneurs** in Africa’s digital economy.  
❤️ I’m passionate about **innovation that inspires**, designing systems that solve real problems and **create opportunities for growth**.  
🌱 I live by this mantra:  
> **“Live joyfully and purposefully, using every gift to create smart, soulful solutions that uplift lives and inspire change.”**
